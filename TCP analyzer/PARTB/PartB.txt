The initial congestion widnow is 1MSS
To calculate congestion window, I calculated bytes that are sent without an acknowldegment and estimated cwnd per rtt.
The congestion window can be estimated at both the sender and the receiver.
The cwnd increases then decrease due to packet loss.

1.Estimation of congestion window at the senders end. 10 congestion windows for each flow.
For flow between ports 43498 -- > 80
[13056, 15928, 17376, 18824, 20272, 21720, 23168, 21720, 20272, 18824, 28960]
For flow between ports 43500 -- > 80
[13056, 15928, 14480, 18824, 20272, 18824, 17376, 20272, 21720, 20272, 28960]
For flow between ports 43502 -- > 80
[13056, 15928, 14480, 13032, 11584, 10136, 8688, 7240, 5792, 4344, 28960]


To estimate the values I check for which packets, the sequence numbers were repeated, if the sent sequence number was recieved thrice the packet was retransmitted 
due to tripdup ack and was fast retransmitted, else the retransmission was due to timeout.
The estimation can be done at both the sender and reciever.

2.Estimation of acks due to timeout and triple duplacte acks.
For flow between ports 43498 -- > 80
Packets due to triple duplicate 2
Packets due to timeout 1

For flow between ports 43500 -- > 80
Packets due to triple duplicate 36
Packets due to timeout 58

For flow between ports 43502 -- > 80
Packets due to triple duplicate 0
Packets due to timeout 0
